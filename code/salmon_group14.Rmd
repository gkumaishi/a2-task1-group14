#### Summary:
This report explores and visualizes data for adult fish passage recorded from 2001-01-01 to 2010-12-31 at the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River (Oregon). Data was tidied and wrangled for target species and ages (coho, coho jack, and steelhead). Each tab visualizes counts for coho and coho jack as well as steelhead across various time increments. Data were shared by and accessed from Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time).

Key Takeaways:

- Observations of coho and jack coho salmon take place seasonally in fall (~September-October).  The number of observations increased in 2009 and peaked in 2010.
- Steelhead trout observations vary from year to year.  A common annual trend is an increase from winter to a peak in summer, followed by a decrease into the next winter.

### Seasonplots

```{r}
# Using pivot_longer() tidy dataset
fish_seasons <- fish_ts %>% 
  gg_season(y = fish_count) +
  facet_wrap(~species_name, ncol = 1, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Counts") +
  theme_bw()

fish_seasons
```

**Figure 2:** Three seasonplots showing trends for three anadromous fish species: Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead at the Willamette Falls fish ladder. Counts of individuals over the course of a year are shown, with each color corresponding to a different year of the study. (Data: [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text)).

#### Notable trends:
- Coho and Jack Coho peak in October, and are virtually absent between December - August. 
- Steelhead show a wider variety in months present, peaking between May - July for most years, but present throughout all seasons in many years. 

### Summary statistics and analysis

```{r, fig.cap="**Figure 3:** Annual salmon counts at the Willamette Falls fish ladder for steelhead and coho species. (Data: [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text))"}
# wrangling to aggregate fish counts by year
fish_annual <- fish_ts %>% 
  index_by(year = ~year(.)) %>% # groups observations by year
  group_by(species_name) %>% # groups observations by species
  summarize(total_count = sum(fish_count, na.rm = TRUE)) # counts observations per year by species

#vizualization of annual counts
ggplot(data = fish_annual, aes(x = year, y = total_count, fill = species_name)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, color = "#317eb1") +
  facet_wrap(~species_name, scales = "free") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Individuals Observed") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")
```
#### Notable trends:
- Steelhead are the most abundant species.
- Coho and jack coho numbers increased toward the end of the decade while steelhead numbers declined somewhat.
