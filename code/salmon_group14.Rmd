#### Fish ladder location:

- An engaging image (with caption, including photo credit) that is relevant to the dataset
- A brief summary (3 - 4 sentences) of the dataset, and what is included in this “report”
- A map of the fish ladder location (you can make this in R on your own, or include an existing map appropriately licensed, with attribution)
- A professionally formatted data citation
- Remember: All code that you used to wrangle the data and prepare the graphs should be available to see if we click on the Code buttons.

Data: "}
#time series plot of adult passage for coho, jack coho, and steelhead.

  filter(species == "jack_coho")

Key Takeaways:

- Observations of coho and jack coho salmon take place seasonally in fall (~September-October).  The number of observations increased in 2009 and peaked in 2010.
- Steelhead trout observations vary from year to year.  A common annual trend is an increase from winter to a peak in summer, followed by a decrease into the next winter.



```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 7, fig.cap = "**Figure 1:** a)  Total number of adult coho salmon observed at Willamette Falls b)  Total daily observed passages of jack coho returning early to the Willamette River c)  Total number of adult steelhead including both wild and hatchery "}
ggplot(data = fish_tsplot, aes(x = date, y = fish_count)) +
  geom_line(color = "#317eb1") +
  facet_wrap(~species_name, 
             dir = "v",
             scale = "free") +
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(y = "Fish count", x = "") +

```  

### Seasonplots

```{r}
# Using pivot_longer() tidy dataset
fish_seasons <- fish_ts %>% 
  gg_season(y = fish_count) +
  facet_wrap(~species_name, ncol = 1, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Counts") +
  theme_bw()

fish_seasons
```

**Figure 2:** Three seasonplots showing trends for three anadromous fish species: Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead at the Willamette Falls fish ladder. Counts of individuals over the course of a year are shown, with each color corresponding to a different year of the study. (Data: [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text)).

#### Notable trends:
- Coho and Jack Coho peak in October, and are virtually absent between December - August. 
- Steelhead show a wider variety in months present, peaking between May - July for most years, but present throughout all seasons in many years. 

### Summary statistics and analysis

```{r, fig.cap="**Figure 3:** Annual salmon counts at the Willamette Falls fish ladder, vizualized by species. (Data: [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text))"}
# wrangling to aggregate fish counts by year
fish_annual <- fish_ts %>% 
  index_by(year = ~year(.)) %>% # groups observations by year
  group_by(species_name) %>% # groups observations by species
  summarize(total_count = sum(fish_count, na.rm = TRUE)) # counts observations per year by species

#vizualization of annual counts
ggplot(data = fish_annual, aes(x = year, y = total_count, fill = species_name)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, color = "#317eb1") +
  facet_wrap(~species_name, scales = "free") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Individuals Observed") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")
```
#### Notable trends:
- Steelhead and are the most numerous species.
- Coho and Jack Coho numbers increased toward the end of the decade while Steelhead numbers declined somewhat.
