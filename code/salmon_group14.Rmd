## Overview {.tabset}

#### Fish ladder location:
![Salmon, Image Source: Portland General Electric](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/img/hydro/willamette_falls.jpg)

- An engaging image (with caption, including photo credit) that is relevant to the dataset
- A brief summary (3 - 4 sentences) of the dataset, and what is included in this “report”
- A map of the fish ladder location (you can make this in R on your own, or include an existing map appropriately licensed, with attribution)
- A professionally formatted data citation
- Remember: All code that you used to wrangle the data and prepare the graphs should be available to see if we click on the Code buttons.

**Figure 1:** Three seasonplots showing trends for three anadromous fish species: Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead at the Willamette Falls fish ladder. Counts of individuals over the course of a year are shown, with each color corresponding to a different year of the study (Data: [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text)).

#### Notable trends:
- Coho and jack coho peak in October, and are virtually absent between December - August. 
- Steelhead show a wider variety in months present, peaking between May - July for most years.
